## Project Overview

Project Tao represents my structured 6-month initiative to establish mastery of mathematical foundations, with a particular focus on mathematical logic, set theory, real analysis, complex analysis, and the fundamental limitations of mathematical systems. This journey aims to develop a deeper theoretical understanding of mathematical principles from first principles.

Mathematics serves as the foundational language for understanding complex systems across disciplines. While I possess a computational engineering-focused mathematics background, Project Tao aims to help me:

1. Comprehend the inherent limitations of mathematical systems through Gödel's incompleteness theorems
2. Understand the axiomatic foundations that underpin mathematical structures
3. Build a firm grounding in set theory and analysis to facilitate advanced study
4. Develop the ability to trace theorems back to their set-theoretic foundations

## Project Structure

The journey is divided into five phases over six months:

1. **Introduction to Mathematical Logic & Big Ideas** (Month 1)
2. **Foundations of Set Theory & Formal Logic** (Month 2)
3. **Real Analysis Foundations** (Months 3-4)
4. **Deeper Dive into Logic & Computability** (Month 5)
5. **Complex Analysis** (Month 6)

## Knowledge Dissemination

Throughout this journey, I'll be creating:

- Weekly blog posts on current learning topics
- A personal "textbook" for each subject
- A searchable database of proofs with multiple approaches
- Monthly seminars and discussion groups
- Video explanations of key concepts
