These songs are demos and motifs of songs of my future instrumental album "You Don't Know How Much I Love You". Except for Intro and Outro which I had the opportunity to record with my bandmates before graduation, the rest of them are made with my telecaster and my laptop. The album is heavily influenced by blues, hard rock and math rock, and with a little jazz and R&B.
