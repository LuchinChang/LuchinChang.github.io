These perfomances are all with my band "Southern Aviators", which I formed and lead as the lead vocalist and the guitar player from 2018 to 2022.

My bandmates are Yisi (guitar), Mushroom (guitar), Alexia (drum), Xiong (keys, sax), Black Bear (sax), JJ (trumpet), Huang (sax), Du (drum), Chirui (bass).
