<h4>Research Statement</h4> 
I ultimately envision helping people establish trust-based communication and expressing their feelings in an authentic and aesthetically pleasing manner, thereby enhancing mental resilience and improving communication online. Therefore, I'm interested in media content creation which I believe could help achieve my goal by enhancing the degree of personalization and customization for future communication. With this determination in mind, I would like to explore Generative AI related topics in my graduate study, including Multimodal Learning, Evaluation Methods, and Co-Creative systems.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
