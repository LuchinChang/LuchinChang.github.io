Welcome! I'm Lu-Chin Chang, or 張律勤 in Chinese. Previously, I got my B.E. in Computer Science from Zhejiang University.

<h4>Research Statement</h4> 
At the heart of my research lies a vision of creation and empathy—two profound forces that connect and elevate humanity. Whether through music, a 3A RPG game, a film, or immersive experiences like VR, art serves as a bridge, enabling self-expression and fostering deep connections. My motivation is to explore how AI can amplify these forms of creativity, empowering individuals to create, collaborate, and share their stories in ways that resonate universally.

Guided by this vision, my research seeks to democratize artistic creation by developing AI systems that are intuitive, inclusive, and adaptable across various mediums. From music composition to interactive game design, I aim to design tools that cater to diverse user needs, offering flexibility for novices and experts alike. By blending technological innovation with a human-centric approach, I hope to make artistic creation more accessible, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve through empathy, imagination, and connection.
