<h4>Research Statement</h4> 
I ultimately envision helping people establish trust-based communication and expressing their feelings in an authentic and aesthetically pleasing manner, thereby enhancing mental resilience and improving communication online. Therefore, I'm interested in media content creation which I believe could help achieve my goal by enhancing the degree of personalization and customization for future communication. With this determination in mind, I would like to explore Generative AI related topics in my graduate study, including Multimodal Learning, Evaluation Methods, and Co-Creative systems.
